    <p class="text">I like you in a way that makes me want to explore this whole world with you — every moment, every place, every small happiness.</p>

    <p class="text">There’s this constant urge in me to treat you like my queen… and honestly, that feeling is one of the best things I’ve ever experienced.</p>

    <p class="text">I want you to remember: I’ll give you everything I can — love, effort, care, support, peace. Not because I have to… but because it feels right with you.</p>

    <p class="text highlight big-line">All I want in return is something simple, but meaningful: <strong>stay with me, truly… till the end.</strong></p>

    <p class="text">Because I’m yours. And you’re mine — in the purest, most honest way I mean it.</p>
